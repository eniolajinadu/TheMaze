## ALX Foundations Final Project -  "THE MAZE"

## OVERVIEW
-- The project aims to create a three-dimensional game using raycasting.



## TECHNOLOGIES
Libraries, Languages, Platforms, Frameworks, Hardware, Books, Resources:
Python programming language
PySDL2 (Python bindings for SDL2)
SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer 2) library
Technology Choices and Alternatives:

Graphics Library: PySDL2 vs. Pygame
Chosen: PySDL2
Alternative: Pygame
Trade-offs:
Performance: PySDL2 can offer better performance as it's a thinner wrapper around SDL2.
Learning curve: Pygame might be easier for absolute beginners, while PySDL2 could be more intuitive for those familiar with SDL2 concepts.

Decision rationale: 
PySDL2 was the preferred choice for this project due to its direct compatibility with SDL2. By aligning with the library used in the original concept, I aimed to streamline development and potential integration efforts. This decision ensured a smoother workflow and potential compatibility with existing SDL2-based resources.


Programming Language: Python vs. C++
Chosen: Python
Alternative: C++
Trade-offs:
Development speed: Python allows for faster prototyping and easier coding.
Learning curve: Python is generally easier to learn and read, making it more accessible for beginners or those prioritizing rapid development.
Ecosystem: Both languages have rich ecosystems for game development, but Python's might be more accessible for beginners.

Decision rationale: Given my familiarity with Python, it was a natural choice for this project. Python's readability, flexibility, and the availability of libraries like PySDL2 made it an ideal platform for rapid development and experimentation. While C++ might offer slightly better performance, Python's ease of use and the potential for quicker prototyping outweighed these considerations for my learning and hobby project goals.

## CHALLENGE
The Portfolio Project is intended to create a maze game using raycasting techniques and PySDL2.

Problem the Portfolio Project is intended to solve:
This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a simple 3D-like environment using 2D techniques, specifically raycasting. It will create an interactive maze game, providing a practical application of graphics programming concepts, game logic, and user interaction. The project will showcase how to create a pseudo-3D visual experience on a 2D screen, similar to classic games like Wolfenstein 3D.

What the Portfolio Project will not solve:
It will not create a fully 3D environment with complex geometries or advanced lighting effects.
It won't implement advanced game features like multiplayer capabilities, save states, or complex AI enemies.
The project won't address optimizations for large-scale, commercial game development.
It won't solve challenges related to cross-platform deployment or mobile gaming.

Who the Portfolio Project will help and/or who the users will be:
Beginner to intermediate programmers looking to understand graphics programming concepts.
Students or hobbyists interested in game development and computer graphics.
Educators teaching introductory game development or computer graphics courses.
Retro gaming enthusiasts interested in understanding and recreating classic game techniques.
Users will primarily be individuals running the game on personal computers for entertainment or educational purposes

Relevance or dependence on a specific locale:
The project is not inherently dependent on or relevant to a specific locale. As a maze game using raycasting, it's a universal concept that doesn't rely on language-specific elements or cultural contexts. The basic principles of the game (navigating through a maze) are understood globally.


## RISKS
Technical Risks:

Difficulties in implementing smooth controls and collision detection
Potential Impact: Frustrating user experience, game feels unpolished
Safeguards/Alternatives:
Implement frame-independent movement
Use simple but effective collision detection algorithms
Conduct extensive playtesting and iteratively refine controls
Consider implementing an adjustable difficulty setting for movement sensitivity
PySDL2 version compatibility or deprecation issues
Potential Impact: Future maintenance difficulties, potential breaking changes
Safeguards/Alternatives:
Specify and document the exact versions of all dependencies
Monitor PySDL2 development for updates and potential breaking changes
Design with modularity in mind to make future library swaps easier if necessary
Performance issues with Python for real-time rendering
Potential Impact: Slow frame rates, laggy gameplay, poor user experience
Safeguards/Alternatives:
Optimize code, especially the raycasting algorithm
Use NumPy for efficient array operations
Consider Cython for performance-critical sections
Compatibility issues across different operating systems
Potential Impact: Game doesn't run on some systems, limiting reach
Safeguards/Alternatives:
Thoroughly test on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
Use cross-platform libraries like PySDL2 consistently
Implement a robust error handling system to gracefully manage platform-specific issues
Provide clear documentation on system requirements and setup procedures


Non-technical Risks:

Scope creep leading to project delays or incompletion
Potential Impact: Failure to deliver a working project, loss of motivation
Strategies:
Clearly define and document the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features
Use project management tools to track progress and maintain focus
Implement time-boxing for feature development
Regularly reassess priorities and be willing to cut non-essential features
 Lack of user engagement or interest in the final product
Potential Impact: Low usage, feeling of wasted effort
Strategies:
Conduct user surveys or interviews early in development to validate interest
Implement engaging features like randomized maze generation for replayability
Create a visually appealing style, even with limited graphics
Plan for easy extendibility to add new features based on user feedback
 Potential copyright issues if using any external assets (e.g., textures, sounds)
Potential Impact: Legal issues, need to rework parts of the game
Strategies:
Use only self-created or explicitly open-source assets
Maintain a clear record of all asset sources and their licenses
If using any third-party assets, ensure proper attribution
Consider a completely minimalist design that doesn't require complex assets
Time management issues due to competing priorities
Potential Impact: Rushed development, cut corners, or project abandonment
Strategies:
Create a realistic timeline with buffer time included
Break the project into smaller, manageable milestones
Use time management techniques like the Pomodoro method
Regularly reassess and adjust the timeline as needed
Take breaks when it feels overwhelming

## INFRASTRUCTURE

Branching and Merging Strategy:
Main branch: Always contains stable, deployable code.
Feature branches: Created for each new feature or bug fix.
Pull Requests (PRs): Used for code review before merging into main.
Merge strategy: Squash and merge to keep main branch history clean.

Deployment Strategy:
Local Development: Develop and test on local machines.
Version Control: Use Git for version control, with GitHub as the remote repository.
Continuous Integration: Use GitHub Actions to run tests on each PR.
Release: Create a release on GitHub when a significant version is ready.
Distribution: Package the game as a downloadable executable using PyInstaller.

Data Population:
Maze Generation: Implement an algorithm (e.g., Recursive Backtracking or Prim's algorithm) to generate random mazes.
Textures: Use simple, programmatically generated textures or include a small set of custom-created textures in the repository.
Game State: Store game state (player position, maze layout) in memory during gameplay.
 High Scores: If implemented, store locally in a simple file format (e.g., JSON).

Testing Tools and Process:
Unit Testing: Use pytest for unit tests, covering core game logic and maze generation.
Integration Testing: Test the integration of PySDL2 with our game logic.
Automated Testing: Set up GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on each PR.
Manual Testing: Regularly playtest the game to ensure good user experience.
Performance Testing: Use cProfile to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
